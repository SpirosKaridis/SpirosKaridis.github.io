Exercise 2 methodology:

bandit0: A simple modification of the ssh command using the -p parameter

bandit1: Connect to bandit1, there is a single dashed file. Access the contents using cat < -

bandit2: -//-, to view the contents of a file with spaces in it's name use cat followed by the file name contained in " ".

bandit3: -//-, cd in the inhere directory, using ls -a -l I get the list of all hidden files, cat the .hidden file to get code

bandit4: -//-, once in the inhere directory and using the ls command we find multiple -fileXX files. All are dashed file names so we use once again the cat < -fileXX to find the one with the code inside
